# NFT_Terms
This repository includes legal agreement templates (also referred to as "Terms" and "Terms & Conditions"). The templates are open source and made available for free for NFT authors, developers, creators and their lawyers. The goal of this repository is to help reduce the time and expense required for NFT creators to establish the right legal structure and terms for their projects.

This repository is not a law firm (nor is it operated by a law firm), and it is not legal advice or representation.  This repository is not intended as a substitute for an attorney or law firm.  Rather, it is intended to provide tools to make it less expensie and time consuming for NFT creators to work with their lawyers.  

This repository is in the beta/experimental stage.  Be on the lookout for updates, and eventually a web-based tool that allows NFT creators and their lawyers to "point and click" to select between different license clauses to create a custom agreement for their project.
